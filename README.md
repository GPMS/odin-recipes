# Recipes

This is my implementation of the [Recipes project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes)
from the HTML section of the Foundations course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)

The actual recipes and images used here come from [allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/),
the focus of this project is to build from scratch a recipes site using
all HTML skills learned in this section

## Skills Used
 - Proper HTML structure following best practices
 - Headings, paragraphs, ordered/unordered lists
 - Image with alternative text for better acessability
 - Multiple pages
 - Descriptive Git messages
